# Python Tasks Repository

This repository contains two simple Python scripts demonstrating basic programming concepts: checking if a number is even or odd, and calculating the sum of integers from 1 to 50.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### Solution
- **File:** `oddeve.py`
- The script prompts the user to enter an integer, checks if the number is even using the modulo operator, and prints whether the number is even or odd.

#### Example Usage
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number
```

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### Solution
- **File:** `add50.py`
- The script uses a for loop to sum numbers from 1 to 50 and prints the result.

#### Example Usage
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Save the scripts (`even_odd.py` and `sum_1_to_50.py`) in the same folder.
3. Open a terminal in that folder.
4. To check even or odd, run:
   ```
   python even_odd.py
   ```
5. To find the sum from 1 to 50, run:
   ```
   python sum_1_to_50.py
   ```
6. Follow the prompts and view the output.
```
